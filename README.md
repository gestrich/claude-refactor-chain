# ClaudeStep

## Overview

ClaudeStep runs Claude Code on individual steps that you define for your project, creating pull requests for each step one at a time. When you merge a PR, it automatically stages the next PR, creating a chain of incremental improvements.

Built on Claude Code and GitHub Actions, it automates the tedious refactoring work that never gets prioritized -- migrations, code cleanup, and documentation that would otherwise sit on the backlog forever.

## Features

- 📋 **Incremental automation** - Write your refactor spec, get automated PRs for each step
- ⚡ **Manageable review burden** - One small PR at a time, distributed across team
- 🔄 **Continuous flow** - Merge PRs when you have time, next PR stages automatically
- 💬 **Context for reviewers** - AI-generated summaries explain each change
- 📊 **Visibility** - Track progress, team stats, and completion rates

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with code to refactor
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com))

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Project

ClaudeStep relies on projects in the `claude-step` folder to source where to find its projects and configuration.

Create this directory structure in your repo:

```bash
mkdir -p claude-step/my-refactor
```

Create `claude-step/my-refactor/configuration.yml`:

```yaml
branchPrefix: refactor/ai-refactor
reviewers:
  - username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    maxOpenPRs: 1
```

Create `claude-step/my-refactor/spec.md`:

```markdown
# My Refactoring Project

Describe what you want to refactor and how to do it.

Include:
- Specific patterns to follow
- Before/after code examples
- Any edge cases or special handling

## Steps

Add your steps using markdown checkbox syntax (e.g., `- [ ]`). ClaudeStep will process these steps in order as it finds them throughout the markdown document.

- [ ] First step to refactor
- [ ] Second step to refactor
- [ ] Third step to refactor
```

**About the spec.md file:**

The spec.md file combines instructions and steps in a single document. The entire file content is provided to Claude as context when working on each step.

**Requirements:**
- Must be valid Markdown
- Must contain at least one `- [ ]` or `- [x]` step
- Steps can appear anywhere in the file
- Each step should be specific and actionable

**Step Lifecycle:**
1. **Unchecked (`- [ ]`)**: Step is pending
2. **Action picks step**: Creates PR for it
3. **PR merged**: Action automatically marks as `- [x]`
4. **Checked (`- [x]`)**: Step is skipped in future runs

### Step 2: Customize PR Template (Optional)

Create `claude-step/my-refactor/pr-template.md` to customize the PR description format:

```markdown
## Step
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

## Changes
This PR was automatically created by ClaudeStep.

## Review Steps
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No unintended changes
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Instructions for Reviewer
If you find issues:
1. Fix them directly in this PR
2. Update spec.md with improved instructions
3. Merge when ready

---
_Auto-generated by ClaudeStep_
```

**Template Variables:**
- `{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}` - The step description from spec.md

If no pr-template.md exists, a simple default template is used.

### Step 3: Add Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/claude-step.yml`:

```yaml
name: ClaudeStep

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]      # Triggers when you merge or close PRs
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allow manual trigger

# Note: The workflow triggers on both merged and closed-without-merging PRs.
# If you close a PR without merging and don't want it to re-open, first update
# spec.md to mark that step as complete (or remove it), merge that change, then close the PR.

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  refactor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: gestrich/claude-step@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          project_name: 'my-refactor'
```

### Step 4: Setup Slack Notifications (Optional)

To receive statistics and progress reports in Slack:

1. Create a Slack webhook at [api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
2. Add the webhook URL as a GitHub secret named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Pass it to the action:

```yaml
- uses: gestrich/claude-step@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    project_name: 'my-refactor'
    slack_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### Step 5: Configure GitHub

#### Add API Key

1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Value: (paste your Anthropic API key)
5. Click "Add secret"

#### Enable PR Creation

1. Go to Settings > Actions > General
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Click "Save"

#### Install Claude Code GitHub App

The Claude Code GitHub App allows the action to interact with your repository. This is a remote GitHub configuration, not a local installation.

In your local repository directory, run this command in Claude Code:

```
/install-github-app
```

This installs the app at the GitHub repository level and grants the necessary permissions for Claude to read your spec and create pull requests.

### Step 6: Run & Test

#### Push Changes to Main

Before the workflow can run, your project configuration and spec need to be on the main branch:

1. Commit your changes (configuration.yml, spec.md, workflow file)
2. Push to your main branch
3. Ensure all changes are merged

#### Trigger Initial Workflow

The workflow will run automatically when you merge PRs (assuming you set up the merge/close trigger above). However, for the first PR, you need to trigger it manually to get the workflow going:

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Click "ClaudeStep" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait ~2-5 minutes
5. Check for new PR!

Once the first PR is created, future PRs will be staged automatically when you merge.

#### What to Expect

- ✅ Workflow runs successfully
- ✅ New branch created: `2025-01-my-refactor-1`
- ✅ PR created with label "claude-step"
- ✅ PR assigned to you
- ✅ First step from spec.md is completed
- ✅ AI-generated summary comment posted on PR (explains changes)

### Step 7: Review & Iterate

#### Review the PR

1. Check the code changes
2. Verify it follows your spec
3. Make any needed fixes

#### Merge

1. When satisfied, merge the PR
2. After merge, workflow will create PR for next step

### Scaling Up

Once comfortable, you can increase capacity and add team members.

**How PR assignment works:**

PRs are assigned per reviewer, not globally. This means:
- Review load is distributed across team members
- Multiple reviewers enable parallel progress (2 reviewers = 2 simultaneous PRs)
- Each reviewer only sees PRs assigned to them
- When a reviewer merges their PR, a new one is automatically created for them

**Ways to scale:**

1. **Increase capacity per reviewer:**
   ```yaml
   reviewers:
     - username: alice
       maxOpenPRs: 2  # ← Increase from 1
   ```

2. **Add more reviewers:**
   ```yaml
   reviewers:
     - username: alice
       maxOpenPRs: 1
     - username: bob  # ← Add team members
       maxOpenPRs: 1
   ```

3. **Create multiple projects:**
   ```
   claude-step/
   ├── swift-migration/
   │   ├── configuration.yml
   │   └── spec.md
   ├── typescript-conversion/
   │   ├── configuration.yml
   │   └── spec.md
   └── api-refactor/
       ├── configuration.yml
       └── spec.md
   ```

## Action Inputs & Outputs

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `anthropic_api_key` | Y | - | Anthropic API key for Claude Code |
| `github_token` | Y | `${{ github.token }}` | GitHub token for PR operations |
| `project_name` | Y | - | Project folder name under `/claude-step` |
| `claude_model` | N | `claude-sonnet-4-5` | Claude model to use (sonnet-4-5 or opus-4-5) |

| `base_branch` | N | `main` | Base branch for PRs |
| `working_directory` | N | `.` | Working directory |
| `add_pr_summary` | N | `true` | Add AI-generated summary comment to PR |
| `slack_webhook_url` | N | - | Slack webhook URL for PR notifications |
| `pr_label` | N | `claude-step` | Label to apply to ClaudeStep PRs |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pr_number` | Number of created PR (empty if none) |
| `pr_url` | URL of created PR (empty if none) |
| `reviewer` | Assigned reviewer username |
| `step_completed` | Step description completed |
| `has_capacity` | Whether reviewer had capacity |
| `all_steps_done` | Whether all steps are complete |

### Input Details

**claude_model:**
- `claude-sonnet-4-5` (recommended) - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-opus-4-5` - Highest capability, higher cost

**claude_allowed_tools:**
Available tools: `Write`, `Read`, `Bash`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`

Default: `Write,Read,Bash,Edit`

Example with all tools:
```yaml
claude_allowed_tools: 'Write,Read,Bash,Edit,Glob,Grep'
```

**Security note:** Only add tools that are safe for your use case. More tools = more power but also more potential for unintended changes.

**add_pr_summary:**
Controls whether an AI-generated summary comment is posted when the PR is created. The summary analyzes the PR diff and explains what was changed and why in under 200 words.

- `true` (default) - Automatically post summary comments
- `false` - Skip summary generation

The summary provides context for reviewers and helps document the changes made. Each summary costs approximately $0.002-0.005 in API credits (based on diff size).

Example to disable:
```yaml
- uses: gestrich/claude-step@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    project_name: 'my-refactor'
    add_pr_summary: false
```

**slack_webhook_url:**
Optional Slack webhook URL for PR notifications. When provided, ClaudeStep posts a message to Slack whenever a new PR is created.

To set up:
1. Create a Slack webhook at [api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
2. Add the webhook URL as a GitHub secret (e.g., `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`)
3. Pass it to the action:

```yaml
- uses: gestrich/claude-step@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    project_name: 'my-refactor'
    slack_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

**pr_label:**
Label to apply to all ClaudeStep PRs. Defaults to `claude-step` if not specified.

This label is used to:
- Identify PRs created by ClaudeStep
- Track reviewer workload and capacity
- Auto-detect projects when a PR is merged

Example to use a custom label:
```yaml
- uses: gestrich/claude-step@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    project_name: 'my-refactor'
    pr_label: 'refactoring'
```

**anthropic_api_key:**
Get your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com), then:
1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Create secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
3. Reference it: `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`

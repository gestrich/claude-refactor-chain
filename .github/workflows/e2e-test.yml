name: E2E Integration Tests

# This workflow runs the E2E test suite which validates ClaudeStep by testing it
# against test projects within this repository (recursive workflow pattern).
#
# The tests create temporary test projects, trigger the claudestep-test.yml workflow,
# verify PRs are created correctly, and clean up all test resources.

You are analyzing changes that were just made by ClaudeChain.

## Context
- Task completed: {TASK_DESCRIPTION}
- PR number: {PR_NUMBER}
- Workflow run: {WORKFLOW_URL}

## CRITICAL: You MUST Use the Write Tool

**YOU MUST USE THE `Write` TOOL TO SAVE THE SUMMARY TO A FILE.**

Do NOT just output the summary as text. The summary MUST be written to a file using the Write tool.

## Your Task

1. View the changes using: `git diff origin/{BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`
2. Analyze the changes made in the diff
3. If helpful, use the Read tool to explore relevant code for additional context
4. Generate a concise summary (<300 words) that explains:
   - What specific changes were made (files, functions, logic)
   - Why these changes were made (purpose, benefits)
   - Any notable implementation details
5. **USE THE `Write` TOOL** to write the summary to `{SUMMARY_FILE_PATH}` in this exact format:

```markdown
## ClaudeChain Summary

[Your summary here - be specific about what was changed and why]

---
*Generated by ClaudeChain • [View workflow run]({WORKFLOW_URL})*
```

6. Verify the file was created by running: `cat {SUMMARY_FILE_PATH}`

Use clear, technical language. Be specific about files and functions modified.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- **DO NOT** just return the summary as text output
- **DO NOT** post the summary to the PR directly
- **YOU MUST** use the `Write` tool to save to `{SUMMARY_FILE_PATH}`
- **YOU MUST** verify the file exists after writing

If you do not use the Write tool, the summary will be lost and will not appear on the PR.
